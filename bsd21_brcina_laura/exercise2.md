## What is the main task of a calculator?
A calculator was invented for quick calculations of various complex numbers. Accordingly, the calculating machine should help us in daily use.

## Programming a simple calculator in Java
The main task of a simple calculator is to read in two simple values from the keyboard and then to display the result on the screen. Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication will usually be possible as arithmetic operations.

## Programming complex calculators in Java
In contrast to the simple one, you can also program a more complex calculator in Java, which can carry out several calculations at once. An example of such a calculator would be a point before a decimal point or the calculation of several numbers with and without brackets.
